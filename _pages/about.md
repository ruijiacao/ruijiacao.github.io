I am Ruijia Cao, a PhD student in the [Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam) at Cornell University. Previously, I was an undergraduate at Georgia Tech, where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Florian Sch√§fer](https://f-t-s.github.io/). My research interests lie at the interface of high dimensional probability/statistics, geometry, and algorithms.
