I am Ruijia Cao, a PhD student in the Center for Applied Mathematics at Cornell University. Previously, I was an undergraduate at Georgia Tech, where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Florian Sch√¢fer](https://f-t-s.github.io/). My research interests lie at the interface of high dimensional probability, geometry, and computation.
